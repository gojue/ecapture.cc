    "body": "## 🚀 Breaking Changes\r\n- Split `nss/gnutls/openssl` into three separate submodules. Corresponding to the `./ecapture nss`, `./ecapture gnutls`, `ecapture tls` commands.\r\n- Support `keylog` mode, equivalent to the functionality of the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` environment variable. Captures SSL/TLS communication keys directly without the need for changes in the target process.\r\n- Refactor the mode parameters supported by the `openssl`(aka tls) module using the `-m`parameter, with values `text`, `pcap`,`keylog`.\r\n  - `pcap` mode: Set with `-m pcap` or `-m pcapng` parameters. When using this mode, it is necessary to specify `--pcapfile` and `-i` parameters. The default value for the `--pcapfile` parameter is `ecapture_openssl.pcapng`.\r\n  - `keylog` mode: Set with `-m keylog` or `-m key` parameters. When using this mode, it is necessary to specify `--keylogfile`, defaulting to `ecapture_masterkey.log`.\r\n  - `text` mode: Default mode when `-m` parameter is unspecified. Outputs all plaintext packets in text form. (As of v0.7.0, no longer captures communication keys, please use `keylog` mode instead.)\r\n- Refactor the mode parameters supported by the `gotls` module, similar to the `openssl` module, without further details.\r\n- Optimize the memory size of eBPF Map, specify with the `--mapsize` parameter, defaulting to 5120 KB.\r\n- Remove the `-w` parameter, use `--pcapfile` parameter instead.\r\n- Change `log-addr` parameter to `logaddr`, with unchanged functionality.\r\n\r\nThanks to the genius idea from @blaisewang.\r\n\r\n------\r\n* 将nss/gnutls/openssl拆分为独立的三个子模块。分别对应`./ecapture nss`、`./ecapture gnutls`、`ecapture tls`三个子命令。\r\n* 支持`keylog`模式，等同于`SSLKEYLOGFILE`环境变量的功能，无需目标进程改动，直接捕获SSL/TLS通信密钥。\r\n* 重构`openssl`(aka tls)模块支持的模式参数，使用`-m`参数指定，分别为`text`,`pcap`,`keylog`三个值。\r\n  * `pcap`模式：`-m pcap`或`-m pcapng`参数来设定。当使用本模式时，必需指定`--pcapfile`、`-i`这两个参数才能使用。 其中`--pcapfile`参数的默认值为`ecapture_openssl.pcapng`。\r\n  * `keylog`模式：`-m keylog`或`-m key`参数来设定。当使用本模式时，必需指定`--keylogfile`，默认为`ecapture_masterkey.log`。\r\n  * `text`模式：`-m`参数不指定时，默认为本模式。将以文本形式输出所有的明文数据包。（自v0.7.0起，不再捕获通讯密钥，请使用`keylog`模式代替）\r\n* 重构`gotls`模块支持的模式参数，与`openssl`模块一样，不再赘述。\r\n* 优化eBPF Map的内存大小，使用`--mapsize`参数指定，默认为5120 KB。\r\n* 移除`-w`参数，请使用`--pcapfile`参数代替。\r\n* 更改`log-addr`参数为`logaddr`，功能含义不变。\r\n\r\n感谢 @blaisewang 的天才思路。\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* ignore connect symbol cant found. by @cfc4n in https://github.com/gojue/ecapture/pull/431\r\n* Add support for stripped go binaries by @h0x0er in https://github.com/gojue/ecapture/pull/426\r\n* splitting gnutls/nss module from tls module lists. by @cfc4n in https://github.com/gojue/ecapture/pull/434\r\n* user: custom mapSize flag. improve memory usage #433 . by @cfc4n in https://github.com/gojue/ecapture/pull/435\r\n* add the `model` flag to distinguish the captured modes, support keylog captured. by @cfc4n in https://github.com/gojue/ecapture/pull/436\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/gojue/ecapture/compare/v0.6.6...v0.7.0",
